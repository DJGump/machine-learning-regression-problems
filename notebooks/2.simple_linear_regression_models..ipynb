    "One of the most simplest and yet very commonly used method for regression problems is linear regression models. When it comes to regression one method is by far the most common: ordinary least squares or \"OLS\". This technique is so common and canonical that people will often refer to it simply as \"regression\", even though there are plenty of other techniques and types of models that qualify as regressions. In this checkpoint we'll cover the basic formulation of the linear regression model and the OLS algorithm."
